I used React + Vite, CSS, and GitHub for deployment. I chose a responsive layout, accessible color contrasts, alt text for images, and clear navigation.

To replicate:
git clone https://github.com/vivianaseibold/WebPortfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev

and open the local host link!

Thank you so much for checking out my site, I hope you enjoy!
